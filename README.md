# Charge Amplifier Circuit For Piezoelectric Sensor

## Project Overview

This repository presents the design and simulation of a signal conditioning circuit for a piezoelectric sensor. The system is designed to accurately amplify charge generated by a piezo sensor (which measures pressure) and then further condition the analog signal for reliable output. It comprises a **Charge Amplifier** stage for initial charge-to-voltage conversion and a **Signal Conditioning Circuit** for amplification, filtering, and buffering.

## Circuit Description

The system is divided into three main functional blocks:

1.  **Piezo Sensor:** The input transducer that converts pressure into an electrical charge.
2.  **Charge Amplifier:** Converts the charge from the piezo sensor into a proportional voltage.
3.  **Signal Conditioning Circuit:** Further amplifies, filters, and prepares the voltage signal for subsequent processing.

### 1. Piezo Sensor (Input Stage)

* **Component:** Represented by a voltage source (C1 2.2nF) in series with a resistor (R1 100k) and capacitor (C2 16.8nF), modeling a typical piezoelectric sensor with its internal capacitance and leakage.
* **Function:** Generates an electrical charge proportional to the applied pressure.

### 2. Charge Amplifier

* **Purpose:** To convert the high-impedance charge output of the piezo sensor into a low-impedance voltage signal. This is crucial for accurately reading the sensor's output without loading effects.
* **Key Components:**
    * **U1 (OPA376):** A low-power, single-supply, rail-to-rail operational amplifier, ideal for precision applications.
    * **R2 (10MΩ):** Feedback resistor, providing a DC path for the op-amp's bias current and setting the low-frequency rolloff.
    * **C3 (2.2nF):** Feedback capacitor, which determines the charge-to-voltage conversion gain ($V_{out} = -Q_{in} / C_f$).
* **Power Supply:** V1 (2.5V) and V2 (1.25V) establish the split supply for the OPA343, allowing for signals around virtual ground.
* **Output:** The output of the charge amplifier (VM1) is a voltage proportional to the charge generated by the piezo sensor.

### 3. Signal Conditioning Circuit

* **Purpose:** To further amplify, filter noise, and buffer the signal from the charge amplifier, making it suitable for analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) or other analog processing.
* **Key Components:**
    * **U2 (THS4531):** A high-speed, fully differential amplifier. This is an excellent choice for driving ADCs and providing common-mode rejection.
    * **Input Stage (R6 1k, R7 1k, V3 1.25V):** Configures the input to the differential amplifier. R6 and R7 act as input resistors, and V3 provides a common-mode bias for the differential input.
    * **Feedback Network (R4 22k, R5 20k):** Sets the gain of the differential amplifier.
    * **Output Filter (R8 100, R3 100, C5 10p, C4 10p):** A differential RC low-pass filter at the output, designed to reduce high-frequency noise and prevent aliasing if an ADC follows.
* **Power Supply:** V4 (10V) and V5 (10V) provide the supply for the THS4531, indicating a higher voltage rail for its operation compared to the OPA343.
* **Outputs:** VM2 and VM3 represent the differential outputs of the signal conditioning circuit.

## Component Selection Rationale

* **OPA376 (Charge Amplifier):** Chosen for its low input bias current (critical for charge amplifiers to prevent discharge of the feedback capacitor), rail-to-rail operation, and single-supply capability, making it suitable for battery-powered applications.
* **THS4531 (Signal Conditioning):** Selected as a high-speed, low-power, fully differential amplifier. Its differential output is ideal for interfacing with modern differential-input ADCs, offering improved noise immunity and dynamic range.
* **Resistors & Capacitors:** Values are chosen to achieve desired gain, bandwidth, and filtering characteristics.
    * `R2 (10MΩ)` and `C3 (2.2nF)`: Determine the charge amplifier's gain and low-frequency cutoff.
    * `R4, R5`: Set the differential amplifier gain.
    * `R8, R3, C5, C4`: Form a differential low-pass filter for noise reduction.
